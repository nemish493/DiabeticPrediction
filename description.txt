About Dataset
The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data
from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative).
The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), 
hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 
This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict diabetes 
in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. 
This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients 
who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized 
treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore 
the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and 
the likelihood of developing diabetes.
